[Reparations (zh-TW)]({% link _posts/2020-06-06-reparations.md %})

有著一個美國的非移民工作者身份，在過去這幾週，我內心一直感到很掙扎。我看到越來越多台灣朋友熱烈地支持川普，但同時近距離看到美國各族裔朋友們在這樣社會動盪下的不安。

Over the past few weeks I've been feeling conflicted, as a newly nonimmigrant in the U.S., I found myself torn between my Trump-supporting Taiwanese friends and my friends in the U.S. of different ethnicities.

我能夠體會台灣獨派為什麼會基於川普反中的態度而想支持他，但同時我又無法理解為什麼了解社會自由、公平、正義的重要性的大家，可以假裝看不見川普毫無遮掩地一再鼓吹暴力、性別歧視、種族歧視、並且推崇極權政府。

On one hand, I can see how some Taiwanese people could make the case of supporting Trump on the basis of his stance against the CPC, the forever oppressor of Taiwanese people and many others; on the other hand, I just can't comprehend how anyone who understands freedom, justice, and equality can in good conscience disregard Trump's blatant advocacy for violence, sexism, racism, and authoritarianism.

我這裡所指的「大家」是台灣這些在過去十年參加或許多社會運動的青年，這些清楚知道解殖的重要性、這些父母親活過二二八後的戒嚴、白色恐怖的人、這些知道台灣人受過哪些壓迫的人、這些知道台語、客語、原住民語及其文化怎麼樣被壓迫噤聲的人。這些人應該要了解社會自由、公平、正義的重要性。不只之於自己，之於所有人類。

I am referring to the young, woke, activist-minded Taiwanese people, who have seen the harm of colonization, who had taken active parts in Taiwanese social movements in the past 10 years, whose parents lived through 38 years of martial law and white terror, who've been deprived of their native tongue and culture, following the massacre of countless Taiwanese activists, as people who should understand freedom, justice, and equality. But it seems like that might not be the case.

我在 Twitter 上透過演算法看到了很多人說「我們受迫害的時候，他們沒為我們發聲，現在他家的事與我何干？」、在暴風雪支持 #BlackLivesMatter 的聲明下留言「香港抗爭的時候你們幹嘛了？」、更用「東突厥斯坦人受苦受難時候你只空講什麼都不做，現在一個黑人死掉有什麼大不了？」來反駁左派媒體聲援 BLM 的報導。

As I've seen from Twitter, through algorithms, people have been saying things like "they didn't care for our sufferings, why should I care about theirs?" and in reply to Blizzard's #BlackLivesMatter tweets, things like "Where was this support for Hong Kong?", and remarks against liberal medias like "paying lip services to the Uyghur while inflating one Black life?"

我起初希望這些留言都是來自一些酸民、偏激的族群，但很快地就發現我有不少朋友轉貼並同意這些言論。

I had wished these comments came from fringe groups, but contrary to what I had hoped, they showed up on my timeline, shared by my immediate friends.

如果每一個迫害的群體都希望別人「先」幫助他，迫害者贏定了啊。如果我們自己都不能對其他被迫害的群體發揮同理心，我們還期待誰能夠理解我們遭受的壓迫？

If every oppressed group wants someone else to care for them *first*, the oppressors will always win. If we can't empathize with others who've been oppressed, who do we expect to be able to understand the struggles and difficulties we all battle against?

我們不該在這個時間點比較誰得到更多支持、比較誰的正義比較需要被聲張。我們應該利用我們對過去的理解、對自己族群所遭遇過的不平等經驗、對社會轉型正義一直以來不斷努力的這些認知來看待、解讀其他不公義的事件，並發揮同理心。

This should not, and can not be made to be about what happened to us, or the justice that we want. However, it should be about us using what we know about the past, about the injustice that we/our ancestors have faced, and about the Transitional Justice work that we have to push for continuously within our society, and applying them to the injustice around us and around the world, to empathize with each other.

我知道每個人的能力、心力有限，無法關心所有世界上的不公不義，但這不該被當成忽略或輕視其他不公義事件和被迫害群體的理由。最最基本，我們也要能夠分清是非、誰義與誰不義。

I understand we all have a limited number of things that we can care for and fight for at any given time, but that should not be an excuse for not making judgments from a place of empathy.

我的亞美尼亞人好朋友 [Garen Torikian](https://www.gjtorikian.com/) 跟我分享了[這篇文章]({% link _posts/2020-06-06-reparations.md %})，讓我有深深的共鳴。我們一樣，長大過程中走過一個又一個立著殺人魔雕像的廣場。我們一樣，在教科書裡只學到他們「光復台灣」的豐功偉業。這一切都不是新事情，歷史早有教訓。有著類似文化背景的我們應該要更能理解、更能付出。

[Garen Torikian](https://www.gjtorikian.com/), my good Armenian friend sent me [this article]({% link _posts/2020-06-06-reparations.md %}), which resonated with me deeply. We too grew up walking through plazas with giant statues of mass murderers. We too learned only about their "liberation of the Taiwanese people" from the textbook. None of this is new. Having so many similarities in our stories, we should know better, and do better.

最後，讓我偷一句 Garen 說的話，因為他文筆比我好多了：

In closing, allow me to appropriate Garen's message as I couldn't phrase it better:

> 我們最缺乏的就是這個—跨越文化的團結力量。

> This is what I want to see more of—cross cultural unity.

希望有共同理解基礎的大家，漸漸也願意多多發聲。如果我們不帶風向，風向就會被別人帶走。

I wish those who share this belief would also know the importance of speaking up. Public opinions, being public, can only be changed if we also participate, in the public.

正義之事，不偏激。

Justice is not radical.
