Today marks my 2 year anniversary at GitHub.

A lot has changed, and I don't even know where to possibly start.

I do know there's one thing that remains to be true â€“ I am still working with some of the best, and kindest people I've ever known. It's still such a privilege to be here, working on a product I love, with people I look up to.

Thank you all for staying awesome. <3<br>
