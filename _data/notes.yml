    Life update: I moved back to Taiwan, finished the 2-week quarantine, mastered the spelling of Q-U-A-R-A-N-T-I-N-E, found an apartment, bought a sofa and 2 plants, took a day trip to Kaohsiung, got back to Taipei, and am currently waiting for the internet company person to come give me life so I can play video games again.

    Excuse me. My whole life I watch people who have nothing at stake argue how much freedom Taiwanese people should have and what government we deserve. Just no. You don't get to decide what's *not that bad* (aka you could suffer more) and what's *bearable* (aka you could power through) when the things did not happen and are not happening to *you*. Believe the people **with the experience** when they say "THINGS ARE FUCKED. IT IS THAT BAD."

    I really wish internationalization settings are more flexible. On PlayStation if I want Chinese subtitles I often need to change my system UI to from English to Chinese, which means voice prompts won't work, and then the game UI also can't be set to English because games usually only have one or two language settings– subtitles and audio, and not UI. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Game content internationalization should prioritize authenticity around the story, while user interface internationalization should prioritize accessibility for the user and social interactions. The data is all there!

"Other countries wouldn't just do what China says, right?" Wouldn't they? Wilder things have happened.

On 10 October 1911, the ROC was established, in **China**, when no one on the island of Taiwan spoke Mandarin. The ROC lost to the CCP(PRC) and fled to Taiwan in 1949, declared martial law, banned Taiwanese, and killed people by tens of thousands. I am Taiwanese. Today is not my national day.

    I was shocked to see more and more Taiwanese people, who know little about US politics, liking the GOP and people like Ted Cruz. Then I recently found out it is because they are the ones in the US Congress lifting Taiwan’s status up for the democratic nation it is, inviting President Tsai to visit and speak against PRC’s wishes, pushing for bills to establish official relationships between the US and Taiwan. Intentions matter, but what can Taiwanese people take from the silence of the Dems?
